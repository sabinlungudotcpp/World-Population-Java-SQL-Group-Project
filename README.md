# Purpose of Agile Group Project :runner:
A "virtual company" gave us a long list of requirements to work through regarding the world population and in an Agile Development Environment, our group have to write SQL code embedded in Java by making use of the Java Database Connectivity Driver (JDBC) to solve the requirements given to us and generate different reports for the company. 

# Code Of Conduct :bookmark:

1. All members must attend meetings.
2. Equal contributions to the coursework.
3. No discrimination (racial, religion, gender etc.).
4. Respect and value alternative viewpoints and, seek, accept and offer honest criticisms of work.
5. Be polite to each other.
6. No distractions; all members must be fully focused on work.
7. All members must have the right tools to do the work (e.g. Docker, Travis, IntelliJ).

# Product Backlog
This section will contain a list of requirements that have been put into a product backlog. As a group we are required to write Java code and SQL queries in order to extract the database results for each of the requirements. We are using Travis Continuous Integration which allows us to continuously test and build this project after we make ***Commits*** and ***Pushes*** which are crucial features of Version Control using Git.
